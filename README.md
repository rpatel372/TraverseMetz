# TraverseMetz
The Tourist Office of Metz identified that many visitors of Metz, France did not visit the tourist office because of a lack of time. This application adressed this problem by allowing users to create self-made itineraries. They can list their interests (architecuture, dining, etc.), their start and end locations, and the amount of time they have available. The application will give them a lsit of options that meet their criteria, which they can select to create the itinerary. This will then be imported to the user's map application.
